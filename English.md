Brief introduction
------------------
* **Plugin of creator:** Outline is a plugin working on the popular game editor cocos creator(we call it creator below).It can export any node or animation in the creator editor to a cocos2dx(we call it 2dx below) project.
* **Features:** Outline is dedicated to  bring 2dx a graphical and component-based industry,and simultaneously,making the work to maintain a high compatibility,high ease of use and migration.Outline is quite different from the official one .First ,it can support 2dx versions under 3.14(I am using the version 3.10,and it works well.The lowest version it can support is not tested).Second it can export any node individually. Finally,it can export your customized component.
* **Export source files** Kind of the file outline exports is c++ source file.Each node(include its child nodes),or each animation clip will be exported in a single hpp file.The exported source file of a node will contain a template tree of the node and its child nodes.I call this tree the creator tree.Each creator instance in the creator tree can be one-to-one matched with a node in the exported node tree,and can also create instance of that matched node.Follow the code hints by IDE,you can get any instance in the creator tree quickly.There are some advantages of exporting source file solution,such as a faster speed in runtime,more prominent security and Extensibility ...The disadvantage is that the source file can not be hot updated.
* **Design idea** As its name shown,outline will pay more attention on the outline of a node,because I find that,the biggest advantage of designing by Editor comparing  with designing by manual is that it can be more intuitive to set the properties,such as the position,scale,rotation and so on,of a node.And these properties can be summarized as the outline of a node.Of cource the infomation of other components will be exported as key-value pairs in the standard map container.
* **Design idea of animation** Outline use an solution that record the state of the playing node in every frame,to export one animation clip. 
 

How to export node
------------------
Asserting you have installed outline in your project.When you open it by creator editor,you can find these changes.Firstly, a item shown as "outline" appears in the menu bar.If you click it , a child item shown as "export rule" will appear.Secondly,In the assets panel,four script files occur in the outline-components folder.They are "ExportRule.js","AnimationRecorder.js","AutoRecorder.js" and "Status.js".The ExportRule script is used to descript an export rule.Just add an export rule by dragging the "ExportRle.js" script into the property inspector of the Canvas node.Then set it in the property inspector and save the project after completing your setting. Finally,export what you want by clicking the "export node" item. 
 
  
How to add customized components
--------------------------------
In creator,you can push some extra information to a node by adding your customized component script into the node.You can also export these information to a 2dx project through outline by just making a mark in the name of the component property.Outline provides two export schemes.A property taking  "o_" as its prefix,will be exported as a member variable of its creator struct;And a property taking "o__" as its prefix,will be exported into the mapAble member variable of its creator struct,with the format "key:value%o__%",that is to say,the data of all such properties of one node will spell a string and be exported as the mapAble member of its creator struct.In the format above,the "key" symbol is the name of exported property,and the "value" is its value,the "%o__%" symbol is the separator between two properties.Currently,the data types of properties outline can export  are int,float,string,bool and cc.SpriteFrame(the path string of its image file).The first scheme is suitable when the property has something about the project logic,such as defining some status of a node.The second scheme is suitale when the propery has nothing on logic,such as defining the node as a controller.
